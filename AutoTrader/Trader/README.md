## Always win strategy
Only sell when bid is higher than the ask you bought at
Buy at any price

## Ask/Bid
The bid price represents the price that a buyer is willing to pay for a share of stock or other security.
-> Use the max(bid) to sell your stuff immediatelly.
-> Use the min(ask) to sell at the same "lowest" price the others wants to sell.
The ask price represents the price that a seller is willing to take for this security.
-> Use the min(ask) to buy new stuff. 
    history trade entry: Buy v1 for price p1

## Sell multiple buys
history trade entry: Buy v2 for price p2
history trade entry: Buy v3 for price p3
Now price is at p4
p1 < p2 < p3 < p4
Its time to sell:
Sell v1 + v2 + v3 at the price of p4?
or sell v3 for p4?
