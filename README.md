## Ask/Bid

The bid price represents the price that a buyer is willing to pay for a share of stock or other security.
-> Use the max(bid) to sell your stuff immediatelly.
-> Use the min(ask) to sell at the same "lowest" price the others wants to sell.

The ask price represents the price that a seller is willing to take for this security.
-> Use the min(ask) to buy new stuff.
