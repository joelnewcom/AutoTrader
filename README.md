## Always win strategy
Only sell when bid is higher than the ask you bought at

Buy at any price

## Ask/Bid

The bid price represents the maximum price that a buyer is willing to pay for a share of stock or other security.
-> Use the max(bid) to sell your stuff

The ask price represents the minimum price that a seller is willing to take for that same security.
-> Use the min(ask) to buy new stuff.
